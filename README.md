# Code Challenge.

:grinning: Hello Recruiter!

This is the repository for the requested code challenge.

:information_source: It was developed using React, TypeScript and Styled Components.

:gear: The reasoning behind choosing React is because it's the required Framework for the job. When it comes to TypeScript, it's an amazing addition to front-end applications in order to improve quality; therefore I use it constantly. 

:rainbow: Lastly, Styled Components make it easier for developers to make our styles respond to the component props, among many other features. That's also a tool that I've been using for quite some time now.

:hammer_and_pick: **In case you wanna see the project working right away, here's a <a href="https://andersonsouza.dev/code-challenge" target="_blank">Live Demo</a>.**
